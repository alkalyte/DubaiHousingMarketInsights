-Clean and preprocess data
-Visualize market trends
-Build predictive models (Linear Regression & Random Forest)
-Evaluate model performance
-Predict price for new input data
**Technologies Used**
-Excel
-Python
-Pandas
-Matplotlib
-Seaborn
-Scikit-Learn
**Files Included**
-dubai_housing_project.ipynb – Main project notebook
-DubaiProjectDataSet.csv – Dataset used in the project
